Greasemonkey scripts for adding RTL languages support to some websites.

---
Some websites are not properly styled to render RTL scripts. This happens commonly in Web 2.0 and specially for texts entered by users.
It could bother when a text block has mixed of phrases from languages differing in direction and this is not an unusual case.
Users generally are not complaining about these problems. They learnt by experience how to get true passage from cluttered text or just gave up and preferred to write entirely in ASCII characters and LTR layout.

Anyway, adding support for *basic* bidirectional text rendering needs only a little code to examine characters by which text had been written and then style them. Just like these Greasemonkey scripts.
